This data science project focuses on predicting house prices using a dataset containing various features and attributes related to residential properties. By analyzing and modeling the data, the project aims to develop a predictive model that can estimate the sale prices of houses accurately.

## DATASET INFORMATION
The dataset used in this project consists of information about different residential properties. It includes a wide range of features that can potentially influence the price of a house, such as type of the area's ,location ,size ,society,balcony ,price and other relevant factors.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to build a robust predictive model for house price estimation. By training the model on historical data and leveraging its learned patterns and relationships, it will be able to predict the prices of new or unseen houses accurately.

## Approach
The project will involve several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Techniques such as data cleaning, handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables will be employed to prepare the dataset for model training. Various regression algorithms, such as linear regression, random forests will be explored and evaluated to determine the most suitable model for accurate price prediction.
